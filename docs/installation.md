# Installation

!!! mcbuddy "I‘m glad you‘re interested to let me move into your Mac!"

To make things as simple as possible for you, I created an [`installer`](https://github.com/macos-buddy/install).

Simply paste the following command in a Terminal (as your user, not root) and I‘ll meet you there to guide you through the installation process.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macos-buddy/install/master/install)"
```

## What will I do?

I will install solid foundations, create your `Sanctuary` and provide `@` to shout your orders. 

After that, you can install the [modules](modules.md) you want; provided by me, third parties, or you.

Check the [features](features.md) for more details.


## What are the requirements?

Basically the same as `Brew`, [available here](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#macos-requirements).
