## Fulfill Your Orders

By providing a user-friendly CLI tool simply called [`@`](terminology/#_1) _…because one keystroke should be enough!_

Born with basic knowledge, I‘m able to acquire new skills easily. You can extend my capabilities by installing the [modules](modules.md) you want; provided by me, third parties, or you.


## Centralize Your Settings

By creating your [`Sanctuary`](terminology/#the-sanctuary), a local [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository where all your settings are centralized.  
Git provides history and backup via remote repositories.


## Protect Your Secrets

By creating your [`Forbidden City`](terminology/#the-forbidden-city), an isolated local [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository where all your secret settings are safely stored.


## Provide Solid Foundations

By installing:

**[`Brew`](https://brew.sh/), [`Cask`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask), and [`MAS`](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)**  
The missing package manager and its companions for macOS native apps and Mac App Store.  
And also its [bundler](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle).

**[`Bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and 
[`GNU Core Utilities`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)**  
The latest version of a shell improved for both programming and interactive use.  
And the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.

**[`iTerm2`](https://iterm2.com/)**  
A terminal for the modern age.
